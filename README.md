The standard 52-card deck is the most widely recognized pack of playing cards used today, particularly in English-speaking countries. It consists of 52 cards divided equally among four suits: clubs(‚ô£), diamonds(<span style="color:red">‚ô¶</span>) ,hearts(<span style="color:red">‚ô•</span>), and spades(‚ô†). Each suit contains 13 cards, including:

- Three face cards (king, queen, jack)
- Ten numerical cards (ace through ten)

Additionally, commercial decks often include one or more jokers(üÉèÔ∏è), typically two or three, which were introduced around the mid-20th century. These jokers serve various purposes in card games, acting as wild cards or replacements for missing cards. The dimensions of a standard playing card are approximately 3 1/2 inches by 2 1/2 inches, and they are coated for durability. This deck configuration supports a vast array of card games, ranging from simple to complex, and is essential for teaching card games or probability concepts [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck).
